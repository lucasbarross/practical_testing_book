### Basics

In software development, mocks are objects that simulate the behaviour of real objects.

#### Why to use it?

In Unit Tests, it can simulate the behavior of a more complex object, making the test faster and, sometimes, even doable

#### Mock in Python

`unittest.mock` is a library for testing in Python. 

> Note: From Python 3.3, it is included in standard library. If you are using a prior version you should install it using `pip install mock`
