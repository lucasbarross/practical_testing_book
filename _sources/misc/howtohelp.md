To understand the basic of Jupyter books skim through this page

As mentioned before the source of this book is at

  <a href="https://github.com/damorimRG/practical_testing_book">https://github.com/damorimRG/practical_testing_book</a>

Essentials:

* Two file formats can be used: .md and .pynb. The first is the
  typical markdown files whereas the later are Python (Jupyter)
  Notebooks that we can use to demonstrate concepts.

* For Python notebooks, the book provides two kinds of integration:
  Binder and Google Colab. When the book shows one of those file you
  will see corresponding icons on the top of the page.

* There are two basic scripts on the repo: build.sh and deploy.sh. The
  first script builds the static web site whereas the second script
  deploys it (although you won't be able to run it).

* To contribute, you need to file a Pull Request so that we can review
  your contributions.
