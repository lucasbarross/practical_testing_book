How To Help
===========

The sources of this book are at two different locations:

This is the repo for the demos:

  <a href="https://github.com/damorimRG/practical_testing_book_demos">https://github.com/damorimRG/practical_testing_book_demos</a>

and this is the repo of the book itself:

  <a href="https://github.com/damorimRG/practical_testing_book">https://github.com/damorimRG/practical_testing_book</a>

Essentials about editing the book:

* To contribute, you need to file a Pull Request so that we have the
  chance to review your contributions.

* This book is created with Jupyter books. To understand the basic of
  Jupyter books skim through <a
  href="https://jupyterbook.org/start/overview.html">this page</a>.

  * Two file formats can be used: .md and .pynb. The first is the
  typical markdown files whereas the later are Python (Jupyter)
  Notebooks that we can use to demonstrate concepts.

  * For Python notebooks, the book provides two kinds of integration:
  Binder and Google Colab. When the book shows one of those file you
  will see corresponding icons on the top of the page.

* There are two scripts on the repo that you should know: build.sh and
  deploy.sh. The first script builds the static web site (under
  directory _build) whereas the second script deploys it in a GitHub
  page branch (gh-pages). Remember that you won't be able to push
  things to the repo (only submit PRs).
